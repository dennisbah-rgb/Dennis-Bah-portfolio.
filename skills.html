                    <p>Football has been a big part of my life since I was a kid. I started playing at a young age and later joined the AIK youth academy when I was 12 years old. Playing football has taught me valuable skills such as teamwork, leadership, discipline, and perseverance. Even though I had to stop playing after a knee injury, my passion for the sport remains strong.</p>

                    <p>My interest in computers and programming began during high school when I studied the Electrical and Energy program with a focus on computer systems. I quickly realized how creative and logical programming can be, and decided that I want to build my future around it. I enjoy working with computers, solving problems, and learning about technology and programming.</p>
